## What is Tazapay's Payment Gateway API?

The Tazapay APIs allow you as an online marketplace or platform to create a payment gateway for cross-border transactions as well as to collect, hold, and release payments among multiple parties from multiple countries.

## Get Started

To get your production API key and also gain access to payment links, please follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Sign in to [Tazapay's dashboard](https://app.tazapay.com/)
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Go to the 'Request API Key' tab and fill in the following information:

   * Platform Name
   * Logo
   * Transaction Type (Goods/Services)
   * Percentage share of Tazapay's transaction fees
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The API key and secret key will be generated as soon as you submit your info in step 2. You will also be able to access creating payment links here.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  ### You can follow the same steps on [sandbox](https://sandbox.tazapay.com/) if you need to test API keys for integration.

Once you've completed the above steps, you'll have access to your APIKey and Secret Key:

| Name       | Description                                                                                    |   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| API-Key    | Will be used to identify your platform while calling our APIs                                  |   |
| API-Secret | Will be needed to generate the authorisation token (signature) which we use for authentication |   |
